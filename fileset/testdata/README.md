Please do not rename the directory `test1`.  If you do, make sure you update the link `test1/subdir/extlink` to point to the new directory.  The point of `subdir/extlink` is that a symbolic link pointing to the root directory of the fileset _by name_, it is an external link because the root directory might be named differently when doing a pull/checkout on another machine.  Here is an example.  If the current workspace path is `/tmp/workspace`, then a link `/tmp/workspace/dir/link -> ../../workspace` is an external link, because the root of the workspace on another machine might be `/tmp/workspace2`, or some alternative.  The correct link would be `/tmp/workspace/dir/link -> ..`.  I know this is an extreme edge case.
